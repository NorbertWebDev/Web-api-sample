Description: 		These APIs made to showcase that the test results can be stored in a custom system(must be a compatible PHP environment).
-----------		If you want to use or administrate in a system what can be a CRM or ITSM, or something with a similar purpose this can be
				a solution for you. This is based on MySQL Database, but it can be changed based on your choice. So it can be stored
				multiple way, just the database.php must be changed, or extend and modify it.
					You can get all the user(s) with existing test result(s). This can be done by follow and make the steps, what are 
				described in the Part 3 section. Create a test result can be done with the steps in the Part 4 chapter.
